    <h3>A compendium of my favorite recipes that I love to cook for my dearest</h3>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Here you will find no-nonsense recipes that I cook for dinner everyday and even some more complex ones, if I'm in the mood for it. Unless it is a Portuguese dish, do not expect authenticity on international cuisine - this is what I cook for my household, not a restaurant. Hopefully, you will like it too!</p>
