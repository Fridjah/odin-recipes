    <h1>Lasagna a la Frija</h1>

    <h2> Ah, lasagna...</h2>
    <p>Garfield's, my sister's and probably a lot of many people's favorite dish. There is something about beef ragu sandwiched between lasagna sheets and delicious sauce that just hits the spot! As kid, my parents had a busy schedule, juggling work and extracurriculars. It was common to eat frozen lasagna every few weeks when they couldn't find the time to cook, and my sister and I loved it! But occasionally, on birthdays or the rare instance my dad was off work at lunch time on a weekend, mom would make her special lasagna from scratch and today, as an adult, I still haven't found a taste quite like it.</p>
    <p>My father is the cook at home, but lasagna is my mom's specialty. Enjoy!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>Beef ragu</p>
    <ul>
        <li>800 g ground beef</li>
        <li>1 large onion</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves</li>   
        <li>1 can of peeled tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 large carrot</li>
        <li>1 can of red wine</li>ole dish, spread 2 tablespoons of bechamel sauce.
        Cover the bottom with lasagna sheets; you can break some apart if needed.
        Fill the first layer with a generous amount of the ragu (about 1 cm thick).
        Finish the layer by pouring bechamel sauce over all the meat and cover again with lasagna sheets.
        Repeat these steps until you are satisfied with the layer number. I think 3 to 4 layers is the best.
        To finish, cover the top layer with the cheese slices and spread the fresh mozarella bits; sprinkle some oreagno on top for garnish
        Bake at 200°C until the top is browned.
        Enjoy!

<h2>Preparation</h2>
<h3>Beef ragu</h3>
<h5>In Portuguese we call this "carne a bolonhesa"</h5>
<ol>
    <li>Finely chop the onion and mince the garlic. Peel and chop the carrot into tiny cubes (like mille-poix).</li>
    <li>Coat the whole bottom of a large pot with olive oil and place on medium heat. Once hot, add the onions, garlic, carrot, bay leaf and red chilli. Let sizzle until translucent.</li>
    <li>Add the ground beef and break it apart with a large spoon or spatula. Add some salt (not too much!), paprika and cumin and mix well into the meat. Let the meat sear for around 2-3 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
    <li>Add the canned tomatoes with the juice and mix well. If you use whole tomatoes, crush them with your hand or with a spatula.</li>
    <li>Finally, fill the same can with red wine until about 4/5 of the capacity and add to the pot. Keep heat on medium level and cover with a lid.</li>
    <li>Once it starts boiling, remove the lid and let simmer until the sauce is reduced to your liking. Taste and add more salt or seasoning as needed.</li>
    <li>To finish, add the basil leaves and chopped parsley and cover with the lid.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Bechamel sauce</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Place the butter on a pot a bring to medium heat. Once melted, add the flour and incorporate with a whisk for a few minutes.</li>
    <li>Gradually incorporate the milk, stirring, always.</li>
    <li>Add the seasonings and leave on medium heat until the sauce is thickened. Do a taste test and adjust the seasoning as needed, and keep stirring to prevent the sauce from gluing to the bottom</li>
</ol>
<h3>Assembly</h3>
<ol>
    <li>In casserole dish, spread 2 tablespoons of bechamel sauce.</li>
    <li>Cover the bottom with lasagna sheets; you can break some apart if needed.</li>
    <li>Fill the first layer with a generous amount of the ragu (about 1 cm thick).</li>
    <li>Finish the layer by pouring bechamel sauce over all the meat and cover again with lasagna sheets.</li>
    <li>Repeat these steps until you are satisfied with the layer number. I think 3 to 4 layers is the best.</li>
    <li>To finish, cover the top layer with the cheese slices and spread the fresh mozarella bits; sprinkle some oreagno on top for garnish</li>
    <li>Bake at 200°C until the top is browned.</li>
</ol>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
